# jdm-win
Set of WPF tools to assist TTRPG dungeon masters. This is not meant to replace VTT apps like https://foundryvtt.com/. It is a set of behind-the-screen tools for DMs running in-person games. JDM is short for Jay's Dungeon Master tools.

## jdm-d35e
The toolkit for running Dungeons & Dragons 3.5e (d20) games. Any actual gaming content should conform to https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/SRD-OGL_V1.1.pdf.

*Created to (a) make my DMing life easier, and (b) because I haven't done any Windows platform development in a very long time.*
